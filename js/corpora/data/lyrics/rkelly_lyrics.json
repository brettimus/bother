It's thirty minutes later \n(Time goes by...) Forty-five minutes later \n(Time goes by...) And now one hour later...\n&lt;","\nA car pulls up to a restaurant \nThe door opens and someone gets out \nFirst thing you see is some heels and a dress \nBlack shades on scarf around her head and mouth \nWho could it be? Why are they here? \nUp the stairs they're goin' \nThrough the door, down the aisle \nLike she's walkin' in slow motion \n \nCheckin' out the place \nAnd she walks lookin' real cool \nPeepin' out through her glasses \nBefore she sits in the booth \nShe goes in her purse; pull a cigarette out \nPuts it in her mouth; he lights it \nThen she blows smoke, pause for a minute \nAnd says, \"What the hell happened?!\" \n \n\"First of all, woman, keep your voice down. \nI ain't tryin' to get loud up in here. \nSecond of all, how was I 'posed to know \nThat your husband was a fuckin' queer?\" \n\"Shh!\" The waitress walks by \nShe says, \"I'll be with y'all in a minute.\" \n \n\"Now, we made a deal. The plan was for me \nTo come home with you. Girl, I did my part. \nSo don't you go askin' me what the hell happened \nWhen I didn't wanna do this shit from the start.\" \nAnd then she said, \"Yeah, right. \nYou didn't wanna do this shit, but yo ass got paid.\" \nAnd then she said, \"Sylvester--\" I said, \"Hold up, bitch. \nAre you crazy? Don't be sayin' my name.\" \n \nShe said, \"Whatever. How come you didn't tell me \nYou was married to Gwen?\" \n\"First of all, between the fake wigs and fake names, \nHow the hell I'm supposed to know that Gwen is yo friend, bitch?\" \n\"Shh! Here comes the waitress again.\" \n \n\"Sorry I kept y'all waiting. \nChild, this place is busy. \nIt's always crowded about this time. \nCan I start y'all off with something to drink?\" \nI said, \"I'll just have a coffee \nWith two sugars, light on the cream.\" \nShe said, \"Vodka, straight up. \nHell...Shit, I need a drink.\" \n \nThen the waitress said, \"Girl, I heard that. \nI'll be right back with your drinks.\" \nAnd then she walks away ; I look back at her \nAnd says, \"She looked familiar to me...\" \nThen she says, \"What?\" I say, \n\"Nothin'. It's just a thought. \nAnyway, girl, I thought the plan was for me \nTo be in that house with you and get caught?\" \n \nShe says, \"It was.\" I said, \"What ha--?\" \nShe said, \"I changed my mind.\" \nI blew smoke, then I put my cigar out \nSaid, \"I'm out this motherfucker, 'cause you wastin' my time.\" \nShe says, \"Wait, don't go.\" \n\"Well, then, god-damn it, talk to me.\" \nShe says, \"You wouldn't understand...\" [starts crying] \n\"...Try me.\" \n[crying] \n\"Cathy?\" \n\"Yes?\" \n\"Try me.\" She blows her nose and says, \n \n\"Well, it all started one night \nWhen I was sittin' in the livin' room, \nAnd sounds like I could hear somebody \nIn the bedroom, moanin' and groanin', \nAnd I knew it wasn't me, \nSo my curiosity \nLed me to believe \nThat he was cheatin' on me.\" \n \n\"Well, how come you just didn't ask him? \nGive him the benefit of the doubt?\" \n\"Because a woman knows. \nA woman just knows when some shit is foul.\" \nAnd then I said, \"Calm down. \nHere comes the waitress.\" \n\"Mmm, like I said, it's busy around this time, \nBut thank y'all for bein' patient.\" \nSaid, \"Can I get y'all anything else?\" \nI said, \"No, that'll be all.\" \nThen Cathy says, \"Sylvester--\" He says, \"Hold on,\" \n'Cause he's gettin' another phone call \n \nIt's Twan sayin, \"Everything a'ight?\" \nThen Sylvester says, \"We workin' it out.\" \nThen Twan says, \"Well, call me if you need me, dawg. \nYou know I'm holdin' you down.\" And I said,\"No doubt.\" \nI hang up, then Cathy says, \n\"Well, lemme get back to tellin' you what went wrong. \nWhere was I? Oh, yeah, \nThe day I heard him arguing on the phone.\" \n \nNow the story goes on and on \nAnd she tellin' him everything that happened \nWhile Twan's outside in the car \nRadio on, boppin' his head, just rappin' \nSylvester said, \"Girl, are you sayin' he was havin' sex \nWith another man on the phone?\" \nShe says, \"Yes.\" I say, \"I can't talk about this.\" \nShe says, \"Why?\" I say, \"'Cause this shit is getting uncomfortable.\" \n \nNow, back to Twan; he turns the radio down \n'Cause he gets a call \nHe says, \"Yeah, what up?\" And a voice says,\"Yo, G, \nI got that information on Tina.\" He says, \"Talk to me, dawg.\" \n\"Well, the word out on the street is the bitch has stopped hoein'; \nDoin' head outta her mama's basement and got a job.\" [chuckles] \n\"Ha-ha is right. The day that bitch stop hoein' \nIs the day they stop sellin' dots. (\"Heh-heh.\") \nYou feel me, Joe?\" \"Word.\" \n\"Where the bitch work at, a candy store?\" \n\"Naw, the job that she got's supposed to be legit. \nI heard your girl all found some ol' waitress shit.\" \n\"Yeah? Waitress, where?\" \"Hold on, I'm waitin' on my people to hit me; \nRoxanne and T own the place.\" \"You shittin' me. \nWhere this place at?\" He says, \"Hold up, \nI'm gettin' a phone call.\" \n \nNow, meanwhile, Sylvester's askin' Cathy, \n\"Well, why you still love him?\" \nThen Cathy says, \"When I saw Chuck, \nI just couldn't lose him to him.\" \nAnd then the waitress comes again \nBut this time she brings the bill \nSlides her a $50, says, \"Keep the change.\" \nShe says, \"Damn, thanks. Shit, y'all, keep it real.\" \n \nAnd meanwhile, outside in the car, \nTwan's getting impatient; his homie comes back to the phone \nTwan says, \"Do I look like En Vogue? \nHe says, \"Why?\" Says, \"Nigga, 'cause the way you got me holdin' on.\" \n\"I gotcha, dawg. I got where the bitch work, live, information and all.\" \n\"Yeah. Nigga, I'm listenin'.\" \"Well, nigga, first of all, \nYou gotta keep me down, 'cause I went through a lotta crazy shit to find her.\" \"Yeah, whatever, I got you.\" \n\"Moved in with some nigga in the Jeffrey Manor, \nIt's 'round the corner, it's a place called Shay-Shay's Diner.\" \n\"Nigga, you forget I just did three years. \nI need the exact address to where this place is.\" \n\"My bad, you right, kid. 9501, that's right off Hallstid.\" \nPause it right there \nNow shoot back into the restaurant real quick \n \nSylvester looks up at the waitress and says, \n\"Excuse me, but it seems like I know you.\" \nAnd at the same time, Twan's in the car, going, \n\"Man, this address sounds familiar...\" \nMeanwhile, in the restaurant, the waitress blows a bubble and says, \n\"Where you know me from?\" \nTwan's homie gives him the name of the place again \nHe looks up at the sign and says, \"What the fuck...?\" \nAnd meanwhile, back in the restaurant, \nCathy's nudgin' me under the table, goin', \"Sylvester...\" \nAnd Sylvester looks at the name tag on her shirt \nAnd noticed that shit says, \"Tina\" \n \nThen, the waitress starts backin' up \nWith this confused look on her face \nWhile Twan's outside on the phone, tellin' his homie, \n\"Man, I'm right outside of the fuckin' place!\" \nThen Sylvester says, \"Hold up. \nI just wanna talk to you for a minute.\" \nThen she starts screamin' Roxanne's name real loud (Roxanne! Roxanne!) \nThis bitch comes runnin' from the back with a skillet \nThen Tina breaks a beer bottle on the table \nAnd says, \"Nigga, I will cut you with this glass!\" \nCathy walks by me, goin' out the door, sayin', \n\"Not tryin' to get loud in here, my ass!\" \nTina starts warmin' around Sylvester, sayin', \n\"We take Tae Bo classes!\" \nThen Twan runs up in the place and says, \n\"I will kill both of y'all knucklehead asses!\" \n([Echoing] Asses!...asses!...asses...asses...)\n&lt;","\n\"Well, well, well. \nIf it ain't Laverne and Shirley.\" \nTina says, \"Hey, Twan.\" Twan says,  \n\"Bitch, don't 'Hey, Twan' me.\" \nSylvester says, \"Calm down, T.\" He says, \"Fuck that; \nI just did three years for these hos.\" \nRoxanne says, \"Who you callin' a ho?!\" He says, \"You, bitch!\" \nShe lost control and said, \"Motherfucker, I'll kill yo ass!\" \n \n\"Stop--\" \"What?!\" (\"Wait a minute.\")\"Come on!!\" \n\"With a skillet?\" (\"Let's talk about it.\") \"Damned right!\" \n\"Bitch, I--\"(\"Before some-motherfuckin'-body gets hurt.\") \"Jump, nigga!\" \n\"Man--\" (\"T, stop--\") \"Fuck that!\" \n\"Wait a minute! \nNigga, think about it!\" \n\"Three years!!\" \n\"Three years; this time'll be worse! \nNow come here.\" \n \nSylvester takes Twan to the side \nTina tells Roxanne to calm down \nThen Sylvester says to Twan, \n\"Look...Now, I know you mad, \nBut before you go around here makin' threats, \nNigga, let's not forget the fact that you're out, \nBut you're still on house arrest.\" \n \nThen Twan says, \"Cool, man. I just wanna ask them \nSome questions about what happened.\" \nSylvester said, \"I feel you, but calm yo ass down, \nOr nigga, you goin' back in.\" \nTwan says, \"I got you.\" \"House arrest!\" \n\"I got you, I got you.\" \"T... \nChill...\" \nThen Twan walks over to them and says, \n \n\"How you doin', ladies? \nTina, Roxanne, please excuse me. \nI mean, where's my manners? \n'Cause, uh, that was very rude of me.\" \n\"Twan--\" \"Naw, I admit \nThe way I came up in here, man, it was kinda wild. \nBut that ain't shit compared to the way things gonna go (\"Twan--\") \nIf THESE bitches don't tell me what went down!\" \n \n(\"Yeah, nigga!\") \"Listen, motherfucker, slow your roll! \nCalm down, nigga; stop this shit!\" (\"Come on!\") \n\"Sylvester, fuck that!

Then what?! \nLIFE, nigga! \nThey'll lock yo ass up and throw away the key.\" \n \nThen Twan starts thinkin' about it \nWhile Tina and Roxanne's watchin' him \nAnd I say, \"Man, forget about it.\" He says, \"No.\" \nI say, \"Well, let me talk to them.\" \nHe say, \"They slick-ass, man, you can't trust 'em.\" \n\"Nigga, it ain't about me trustin' them, \nIt's about you trustin' me right now.\" \n \n\"Nigga, what's wrong with you?

[blows smoke] \nSafe, that is.\" \nHe flicks the ashes and says, \"OK. \nWhich one of y'all gonna start talkin' first?\" \n \nThen Tina start cryin', sayin', \n\"It was supposed to be a simple operation.\" \nAnd Roxanne said, \"If we delivered, \nMuscle Man here said it would be a vacation.\" \nTwan says, \"Man, I'll show you a vacation; (\"Twan--\") \nI'll send y'all ass straight to the motherfuckin' moon!\" \n\"Twan!

He got the radio loud, \nBumpin' Mary Jane, just swervin' and shit.\" \n\"Did you tell him to stop?\" \"Yeah, I told him to stop, (\"Stop!\") \nBut he just kept yelling out to me, \"Nah, I'm Rick James, bitch!\" \n \nSylvester looks at Twan \nTwan says, \"Man, I was drunk!\" \nSylvester said, \"Drunk?! \nYou was drunk?!\" Twan says, \n\"Man, I don't know; I was just tryin' to have a little fun.\" \n\"With a whole lotta heat in the trunk?! \nMan, I'm disgusted. \nNigga, no wonder yo ass got busted.\" \n \nThen Twan says, \"Man, whose side \nAre you on anyway?!

back way. \nHe hear the dogs barking like somethings wrong. \nHe gets to the backdoor and discover its been broken in. \nHe looks around, pulls his gun out, then proceeds in. \nMeanwhile were laughing and laughing and laughing. \nBut from his perspective he thinks somebodies crying. \nHe gets closer to the bedroom and he would swear that somebody was coughing and sighing. \nMeanwhile were in the bedroom laughing as I'm trying to continue to explain. \nShe yells out Sylvester your killing me. \nSaid I swear that it went that way. \nThen next thing you know he bust up in the room said

POW.\n&lt;","\nThere's total silence, blood everywhere \nAnd confusion on their faces as they continue to stare \nThen Gwen starts shakin' and cryin' screamin' \"What did you do?\" \nAnd then the policeman looks at me and screams \"See, now I warned you.\" \nThen he starts pacing the floor screamin' \"God, what have we done here?!\" \nAnd she rushed to to door, blood on her hands screamin' \"There goes your whole career.\" \nMeanwhile, I'm freakin' out sayin' \"We gotta do somethin' and gotta do somethin' quick.\" \nThen he picks up the gun and says \"I have a wife at home, I can't have no cause of this.\" \nShe says \"James, I can't believe you just said what you said. \nCause that's not what you said when your ass was in my bed.\" \nThen I said \"Gettin' married later, but right now we gotta use our heads. First of all, did anybody check if the man was alive or dead.\" \nThen he looks at her, she looks at me, I look at them and we look at him.  \nMeanwhile, Gwen's about to have a nervous breakdown the way she's shakin' and cryin' \nAnd then she screams \"You bastards! You've killed my brother.\" \nAnd then I said \"Gwen, wait a minute, I didnt...\" \nShe says \"No, you killed my brother.\" \nShe said \"He just got out of prison. He's been through a lot. He was talking about changin' his life and everything and to come home and get shot \nThen I said \"Baby, it wasn't my fault. This man had a gun on me. \nAnd besides, how was I to know that you was getting down with this crooked ass police.\" \nAnd he says \"Wait a minute...\" I say \"No, you wait a minute!\" \nAnd then I say \"Man, this is my wife. We had a life until you butted up in it.\" \nShe cried out \"Sylvester, now hold on. Even though he was in our home, let's not forget the fact that you was out there creepin' in another man's home.\" \n*Cough cough* *cough cough*  \nTwan starts coughin'. *cough cough* \nShe says \"Twan! Oh my god! Baby brother, are you okay ?\" \nHe looks up at her and says \"I'm not gonna die, at least not today.\" \nAnd then he asks what happened and says \"Why did I get shot? \nSylvester what is this policeman doin' here ?\" \nAnd I said \"Go on, tell him cop.\" \nHe says \"Son, we gotta get you to a hospital and take a look at that wound.\" \nTwan says \"No, I'm okay. It's just my shoulder. All I need is a bathroom.\" \nNow five minutes has gone by and they tellin' Twan everything that happened \nTwan says \"Fuck man, I would've been better off in prison.\" \nAnd now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like \"Oh no! Here we go again!\" \nThinkin' out loud to myself sayin' \"When is this shit gonna end ?!\" \nThen Gwendolyn looks at me and says \"Baby, you got that?\" And I say \"NO!\" \nShe says \"Why?\" And i said \"Because I'm not openin' up another motherfuckin' door!\" \nAnd the cop says \"Gwen, I'll get it.\" Then looks at me and says \"Man of the house, my ass!\" \nThen I say \"I'll get it, but whoever it is, I'm about to put their ass on blast!\" \nAnd then, the policeman grabbed me. I snatched away and got my gun up off the floor \nThen Twan says \"Man, that's what I'm talkin' about! Sylvester, point that shit toward the door! \" \nThen he snatches the policeman's gun and says \"Officer, arrest me later.\" \nI count to three, Twan opened the door and it's Rose the nosy neighbor... \nOoh, with a spatula in her hand  \nLike that's gon do something against them guns \nIt's Rosy the nosy...whoa \nNeighbor....\n&lt;","\nThe policeman gets in his car \nAnd gets right on the phone \nBacking up, shaking his head saying  \n\"Let me get my crazy ass home\" \nAnd his wife picks up and says \n\"Darlin' where have you been,  \ni've been worried about you\" \nAnd he says \"Police business, honey, I can't wait  \nto tell you what I've been going through\" \nShe says \"Are you okay?\" \"Yes\" \n\"Do you need anything?\" \"No\" \n\"Well, I baked you a pie\" \"Mmm\" \n\"Your favorite: Cherry\" \nThen he said \"I'll be there soon. \nSorry I kept you hanging\" \nThen she said, \"Honey, don't worry about it \nJust take your time, I still got some cleanin'\" \nNow meanwhile Misses Roseys back at Gwen's house \nTellin it all \nShe said \"I knew there was something about that policeman \nI started to cut lose my dog\" \nGwendolyn looks at her and laughs and says  \n\"Miss Rosey you are nuts\" \nAnd i say \"all I wanted to know  \nwas what was you gonna do with that spatula\" \nAnd then we all laughed \nTron says \"shes a G no doubt\" \nNow lets head right back on over \nTo the policeman's house \nHe pulls up in the garage \nShe doesn't expect for him to come that soon \nShe rushed to the door  \nkisses him on the cheek and says \"I was in the restroom\" \nThen he said \"Whatcha say that for?\" \nAnd then she says \"I don't know\" \nThen he step back, look at her and says  \n\"Whatcha all jittery for?\" \nThen she says \"Sweetheart, maybe it's that time of the month\" \nThen he says \"Maybe?

believing in his word and \nGot so mad at him and \nWhen somebody said God's good \nI just laugh at 'em \n \nBut in the nick of time his blessing \nRain on me \nBy his grace the phone ring \nA lady said were hiring and  \nThat's when I knew \n \nYou saved me [4x] \n \nNow i was 18 out there on the block \nSelling drugs \nWith a gun at my waist \nAnd for people I had no love \nSee the streets was my home \nFamily and friends were all gone \nHad no one to trust \nAnd deep inside i was all alone \nAnd a deal went bad one day \nAnd it was enough to pause me \nI was shot 4 times and before i
